# Aerospace-Guidance-and-Control-Systems-Autopilot-Project
Complete Autopilot design for an aircraft knowing its derivatives.
Autopilot refers to a collection of systems that automate a plane’s operations. The complex computer matrix
tells your plane how to fly, including navigation, altitude, speed, and engine thrust, which controls the force
by which the plane moves through the air. When these systems are engaged—after a human enters the flight
destination information, autopilot culls data about the flight route, location, and navigation—the navigation
harnesses the same GPS technology that’s on your cell phone and spits out an optimized flight plan. 
The system itself works on a negative feedback loop, which means it receives data from the aircraft’s various mechanisms and responds by inhibiting
a particular action in response to another action. 

The documentation explains all the project steps. You will only need MATLAB ( any version ) and of course SIMULINK to re-create the project.
